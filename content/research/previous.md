## Spinal Cord Injury
As an undergraduate student in [Steve Perlmutter's](https://depts.washington.edu/neurogrd/people/faculty/steve-i-perlmutter/) lab, I contributed to work in spinal cord injury and rehabilitation in rat models. 

My undergraduate honors thesis on the changes in gene expression in rat spinal cords with therapy can be read [here](pdf/IJH_Thesis_RNA_Seq.pdf).

My code for training networks to track rats on a horizontal ladder and use heuristics to score the behavior is located [here](https://github.com/ijhua/ladderwalk). My additional work to train a supervised training algorithm to quantify the behavior is located in [this repo](https://github.com/ijhua/ladderwalk-ML). 

## Circadian Rhythms
As a high school student, I worked in [Horacio de la Iglesia's lab](https://depts.washington.edu/delaiglesialab/wordpress/) to investigate the intersection of sleep and circadian rhythms in humans, particularly students. 

Some of this code I wrote back then to process the actimetry data is publically available [here](https://github.com/ijhua/Open-Export-Files). More recently, I've contributed to additional analysis of these data and the code for producing the clock plots for a poster is available [here](https://github.com/ijhua/clockplots).
