## Spinal Cord Injury
As an undergraduate student in [Steve Perlmutter's](https://depts.washington.edu/neurogrd/people/faculty/steve-i-perlmutter/) lab, I contributed to work in spinal cord injury and rehabilitation in rat models. 

## Circadian Rhythms
As a high school student, I worked in [Horacio de la Iglesia's lab](https://depts.washington.edu/delaiglesialab/wordpress/) to investigate the intersection of sleep and circadian rhythms in humans, particularly students. 

Some of this code I wrote back then to process the actimetry data is publically available [here](https://github.com/ijhua/Open-Export-Files). More recently, I've contributed to additional analysis of these data and the code for producing the clock plots for a poster is available [here](https://github.com/ijhua/clockplots).
