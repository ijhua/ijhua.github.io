## Spinal Circuits and Plasticity
I was a postbaccalaureate fellow in [Ariel Levine's lab](https://research.ninds.nih.gov/levine-lab) at the National Institutes of Health. I am particularly interested in understanding how the spinal cord contributes to the control of movement. I contributed to numerous projects, including [a review of genetic tools for studying the cellular basis of behavior](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.expneurol.2021.113879), [an atlas of single cell data of the mouse spinal cord after injury](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-33184-1), and a cellular taxonomy of the adult human spinal cord (in press). 

## Spinal Cord Injury
As an undergraduate student in [Steve Perlmutter's](https://depts.washington.edu/neurogrd/people/faculty/steve-i-perlmutter/) lab, I contributed to work in spinal cord injury and rehabilitation in rat models. 

My undergraduate honors thesis on the changes in gene expression in rat spinal cords with therapy can be read [here](pdf/IJH_Thesis_RNA_Seq.pdf).

My code for training networks to track rats on a horizontal ladder and use heuristics to score the behavior is located [here](https://github.com/ijhua/ladderwalk). My additional work to train a supervised training algorithm to quantify the behavior is located in [this repo](https://github.com/ijhua/ladderwalk-ML). 

## Circadian Rhythms of Students
As a high school student, I worked in [Horacio de la Iglesia's lab](https://depts.washington.edu/delaiglesialab/wordpress/) to investigate the intersection of sleep and circadian rhythms in humans, particularly students. I continued to contribute to the project which you can read about in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/jpi.12843). 

Some of this code I wrote back then to process the actimetry data is publically available [here](https://github.com/ijhua/Open-Export-Files). More recently, I've contributed to additional analysis of these data and the code for producing the clock plots for a poster is available [here](https://github.com/ijhua/clockplots).
