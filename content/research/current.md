Currently, I am a postbaccalaureate fellow in [Ariel Levine's lab](https://research.ninds.nih.gov/levine-lab) at the National Institutes of Health. I am particularly interested in understanding how the spinal cord contributes to the control of movement. 

Some code I wrote to process thresholded images for markers for the single cell atlas preprint is available [here](https://github.com/ijhua/pixel_counts).
