## Custom Karabiner shortcuts for Qbank use
I used [Goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo/tree/master) to generate custom shortcuts for [Karabiner elements](pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) to use with my mini 8bitdo bluetooth controller. These types of controllers are very popular with medical students, especially to use with the flashcard app Anki. I personally prefer other methods of studying, but wanted the convenience of using keyboard shortcuts for the rest of my studying, including with question banks and note-taking.

## Machine learning algorithm for prediciting behavioral scores
As a part of a bioinformatics course in machine learning, I created [this repo](https://github.com/ijhua/ladderwalk-ML). It contains all my analysis in training support vector machines and random forests to predict the behavioral outcomes of animals based on tracked movements.
