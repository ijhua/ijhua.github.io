## Custom hand-built keyboard
Following guides online, I built a mechanical keyboard by hand. Project details and progression to follow soon in a blog post!


## Machine learning algorithm for prediciting behavioral scores
As a part of a bioinformatics course in machine learning, I created [this repo](https://github.com/ijhua/ladderwalk-ML). It contains all my analysis in training support vector machines and random forests to predict the behavioral outcomes of animals based on tracked movements. 


## First ever website
In my first year of college, I became interested in making websites and built [this one](https://ijhua.github.io/simpledogs/) as an exercise in HTML/CSS/JS. Check it out for some cute dog pictures.
