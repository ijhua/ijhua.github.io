## Medical School Admissions Transparency and Mentorship Project

Going through the medical school application process during a pandemic let me connect with a likeminded community of aspiring physician-scientists. Together, we've formed [Docs2Be](https://docs2be.org/), an organization whose goal is to make medical school admissions more transparent and accessible. 

Part of this includes creating [CycleTrack](https://cycletrack.docs2be.org/), which makes application tracking public and free. Our repository is located [here](https://github.com/RunningMSN/CycleTrack). 

I've also done [some analyses](https://github.com/ijhua/aamc_live) on the available FACTS data from the AAMC which can be seen on [this website](https://docs2be.org/admitdata/).


## Words and Numbers Game

During the early stages of the pandemic, I began watching a British TV show involving a game with letters and numbers. Inspired by this game, I sought to recreate it in Python. So far, I've created a version of the word game that's available as a unix executable or ipython notebook [here](https://github.com/ijhua/wordsnumbers).
