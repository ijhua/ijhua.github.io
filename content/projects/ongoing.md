## Medical School Admissions Data

Going through the medical school application process, particularly for MD/PhD programs, made me curious about trends in admissions. I've begun doing analysis of historical public data from the AAMC in [this repo](https://github.com/ijhua/aamc_admissions). 

It's also been a great way to learn and practice data processing and visualization. Preliminary graphs and figures are available [at this website (still undergoing construction)](https://ijhua.github.io/aamc_admissions/). 


## Words and Numbers Game

During the early stages of the pandemic, I began watching a British TV show involving a game with letters and numbers. Inspired by this game, I sought to recreate it in Python. So far, I've created a version of the word game that's available as a unix executable or ipython notebook [here](https://github.com/ijhua/wordsnumbers).
